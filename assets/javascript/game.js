// pseudo code
// assign each crystal a random number between 1-12 at the begining of each game 
// a random number between 19-120 generates at the begining of each game
// each crystal click will reveal the random number that was generated for that crystal, subsequent clicks will add the new number revealed to the last number generated when clicked
// if all crystal numbers added up to equal the random number generated the  player wins, the total wins is updated by 1 and the game starts over.
// if all the crytals add up higher than random number generated the player loses and game the total losses is updated by 1 and the game starts over.
// when game starts new crystal numbers will be randomly generated (hidden) also a new random number will be generated
