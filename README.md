_This game does not have a reset you will have to refresh the page for that. It uses HTML CSS Javascript and Jquery and it shows how they all work together to create a functioning game. I've made some notes throughout the fils and the most notes in the game.js file for anyone who doesn't fully know or understand how the javascript and jquery work. I did this in hopes that they will have a better understanding of how javascript and jquery function_
